car rental project for CSE 3330 Databases

The main objective was to showcase the database aspect of the project.
The building of the database with sql and all required queries.

Report.pdf is a final overview of the project that had to be turned in along with Dump20200703.sql(MySQL dump file). 

CSV files are the database tables created. 

I did all the coding. The queries were done as a pair with a fellow student.

The UI is quite crude but the only important part was the database work.
